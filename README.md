# 🎧 Audio Codec Subsystem for Bluetooth SoC

## 📑 Overview

This repository contains the design, simulation, and integration files for the **Audio Codec Subsystem** within a Bluetooth SoC project. The subsystem is designed using **analog and mixed-signal components** and implemented through **Cadence tools** and **open-source EDA tools** wherever applicable.

The primary objective of this project is to design, verify, and integrate essential analog blocks, enabling efficient audio signal processing within a Bluetooth-enabled SoC.
